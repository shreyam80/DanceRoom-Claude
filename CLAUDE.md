# DanceRoom — Claude Context

## What This Project Is

DanceRoom is a desktop-first web MVP for dance studio pilots. Choreographers upload rehearsal videos, leave timestamped targeted feedback comments, and dancers watch the videos with auto-pausing playback and acknowledgement. The MVP is fully built and functional.

**Core workflow:**
1. Choreographer creates org → team → adds dancers by email → creates subgroups → creates routine
2. Choreographer uploads video to routine (direct to Supabase Storage)
3. Choreographer opens review page, watches video, clicks "+ Add feedback at M:SS", picks target (individual dancer / subgroup / whole team), writes comment
4. Dancer logs in, sees their teams, opens routine, clicks "Watch"
5. Video auto-pauses at each feedback timestamp, dancer reads it and clicks "Acknowledge"
6. Either side can "Resolve" a comment to mark it done

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python 3.9) + uvicorn |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email/password, no email confirmation) |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) with RLS |
| Storage | Supabase Storage — public bucket `rehearsal-videos` |
| HTTP client | Axios with Bearer token interceptor |
| Router | React Router v7 |

---

## How to Run

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
# Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Environment Variables

**`backend/.env`** (never commit):
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://hfupatqnbgtxjsbuczgq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service role JWT>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**`frontend/.env`** (never commit):
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hfupatqnbgtxjsbuczgq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon JWT>
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**Critical:** The backend uses the **service role key** (bypasses RLS). The frontend uses the **anon key** (for Supabase Auth only). Never mix them up. The SUPABASE_URL must be the base URL only — no `/rest/v1/` suffix.

## Database Schema (13 tables)

```
users                  — mirrors auth.users, adds role/username/full_name
organizations          — created by choreographers
organization_memberships — user ↔ org (role: admin/member, status: active)
teams                  — belong to an org; has archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ (NULL = active)
team_members           — user ↔ team (role: choreographer/dancer, status: active)
subgroups              — sub-grouping within a team
subgroup_members       — user ↔ subgroup
routines               — belong to a team; has archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ (NULL = active)
videos                 — belong to a routine, have file_url + storage_path + version_number
video_views            — one row per (user_id, video_id) once first played; tracks watched status
comments               — on a video, with video_timestamp_seconds and target_type (individual/subgroup/team)
comment_targets        — one row per comment, records the specific target (user_id / subgroup_id / team_id)
comment_recipients     — expanded per-dancer rows; tracks acknowledged_at and status
```

**Important:** `organizations.type` has a NOT NULL constraint in the DB (even though the migration says nullable). Always send `body.type or ""` — never send null.

## API Surface (round 2 additions)

### Videos
- `DELETE /videos/{id}` — choreographer only; deletes from DB + Supabase Storage
- `POST /videos/{id}/viewed` — upsert into video_views; called on first play in VideoWatchPage

### Routines
- `PATCH /routines/{id}` — `{ archived: bool }` — archive/unarchive
- `DELETE /routines/{id}` — hard delete (cascades to videos, comments)

### Teams
- `PATCH /teams/{id}` — `{ archived: bool }` — archive/unarchive
- `DELETE /teams/{id}` — hard delete (cascades everything)
- `DELETE /teams/{id}/members/{user_id}` — remove dancer (comments preserved)
- `GET /teams?archived=true` — returns archived teams the user is a member of (both roles)
- `GET /teams?organization_id=X&archived=true` — choreographer: archived teams for a specific org

### Subgroups
- `PATCH /subgroups/{id}` — `{ name: str }` — rename
- `DELETE /subgroups/{id}` — hard delete (cascades members)
- `DELETE /subgroups/{id}/members/{user_id}` — remove member from subgroup

### Enriched GET responses
- `GET /teams` — dancer callers get `unread_comment_count` per team
- `GET /teams/{id}` — routines include `unread_comment_count` + `has_unwatched_video`; also returns `archived_routines` array
- `GET /routines/{id}` — videos include `is_watched: bool` (checked against video_views)
- `GET /organizations/{id}` — teams list filters out archived teams

---

## Auth Architecture

### Two auth dependencies (backend/auth.py)

- **`get_current_auth_user`** — validates JWT only, does NOT require a profile row in `public.users`. Used only by `POST /users` (the profile creation endpoint itself).
- **`get_current_user`** — validates JWT AND fetches the `public.users` profile row. Returns the full profile dict. Used by all other protected routes.

### Why two dependencies exist
`POST /users` is the profile creation endpoint. If it used `get_current_user`, it would require the profile to already exist — a circular dependency. The fix was `get_current_auth_user` which only validates the JWT.

### Signup flow (frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
1. `supabase.auth.signUp()` → returns `data.user` and `data.session`
2. Immediately `POST /users` with the token from `data.session.access_token` passed **directly** in headers (not via interceptor), because `getSession()` may lag behind the new session
3. `fetchProfile()` to populate context

### Login flow
1. `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
2. Try `GET /users/me` — if 404, auto-create profile from `data.user.user_metadata`
3. Profile is set in context

### Axios interceptor (frontend/src/lib/api.ts)
Every request gets `Authorization: Bearer <token>` injected from `supabase.auth.getSession()`. No manual token handling in components.

---

## Supabase Storage

- Bucket name: `rehearsal-videos` (public bucket)
- Upload path: `{user_id}/{routine_id}/{timestamp}.{ext}`
- Files uploaded directly from the frontend using the Supabase JS client
- Public URL retrieved via `supabase.storage.from('rehearsal-videos').getPublicUrl(path)`
- URL stored permanently in `videos.file_url` — no signed URLs, no expiry
- Required storage policies (run once in Supabase SQL editor):
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'rehearsal-videos');

  CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'rehearsal-videos');
  ```

---

## Critical Bugs Fixed (do not reintroduce)

### 1. `maybe_single()` returns `None` when no row found
In supabase-py v2.4.2, `maybe_single().execute()` returns `None` (not an object with `data=None`) when no row matches. Accessing `.data` on `None` crashes with AttributeError → 500.

**Pattern used everywhere:**
```python
result = supabase.table(...).maybe_single().execute()
if not result or not result.data:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, ...)
```

For "does this membership exist?" checks, use `.limit(1)` instead:
```python
existing = supabase.table(...).limit(1).execute()
if existing and existing.data:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Already a member")
```

### 2. `POST /users` circular dependency
Using `get_current_user` on `POST /users` caused a 404 loop (profile doesn't exist → can't create profile). Fixed by using `get_current_auth_user` (JWT-only validation) on that one endpoint.

### 3. Signup token lag
After `supabase.auth.signUp()`, calling `supabase.auth.getSession()` via the axios interceptor may not have the new session yet. Fixed by passing `data.session.access_token` directly in the `POST /users` call headers.

### 4. org type NOT NULL
The `organizations` table has `type TEXT NOT NULL` in the DB. The backend always sends `body.type or ""` to avoid null violations.

### 5. Supabase email confirmation
Email confirmation must be **disabled** in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → "Confirm email" toggle OFF. Otherwise signup returns "Email not confirmed" error.

### 6. Do NOT add `crossOrigin="anonymous"` to video elements
Adding this attribute causes CORS preflight checks against Supabase Storage. When the preflight interaction silently fails, the browser blocks the audio track while still rendering video frames — resulting in a greyed-out volume button. The video elements must load without CORS mode (no `crossOrigin` attribute). Note: the greyed-out volume seen during development was a VSCode preview artifact — audio works correctly in the actual browser.

## Comment System

### Creating a comment (POST /comments)
1. Insert into `comments` (has `target_type`: individual/subgroup/team)
2. Insert into `comment_targets` (records the specific target ID)
3. Expand to `comment_recipients`:
   - `individual` → 1 row
   - `subgroup` → one row per `subgroup_members` row
   - `team` → one row per active `team_members` row (excluding the author)

### GET /videos/{id}/comments (choreographer)
Returns all comments enriched with `target_label` and `target_id` (fetched from `comment_targets` + users/subgroups tables).

### GET /videos/{id}/comments/my (dancer)
Returns only comments where the caller has a `comment_recipients` row. Includes `acknowledged_at`.

### Acknowledge flow
`POST /comments/{id}/acknowledge` → sets `acknowledged_at` and `status = 'acknowledged'` on the `comment_recipients` row.

### Dancer auto-pause behavior (VideoWatchPage.tsx)
- `acknowledgedIds` ref (Set<string>) — pre-populated on load from server-confirmed `acknowledged_at`. Only grows via `handleAcknowledge()`. Never modified by "Skip".
- `skippedRef` — holds `{ id, time }` for the most recently skipped comment. Cleared once the video moves more than 2 seconds past that timestamp.
- Trigger condition: `!acknowledgedIds.has(id) && skippedRef?.id !== id && |time - timestamp| < 0.5`
- "Skip for now" sets `skippedRef` (not `acknowledgedIds`) — so the modal re-fires on the next pass through that timestamp.
- "Acknowledge" calls the API, adds to `acknowledgedIds`, and resumes playback.

---

## Archive System

- Both `teams` and `routines` have an `archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column (NULL = active).
- Choreographers can archive/unarchive via PATCH with `{ archived: bool }`.
- `GET /teams` and `GET /organizations/{id}` filter out archived items by default.
- Archived routines are returned in a separate `archived_routines` array from `GET /teams/{id}`.
- Dancers can see archived teams (collapsible section on Dashboard) and archived routines (collapsible section on TeamPage) — read-only view, no unarchive button.
- Choreographers see the same sections with an "Unarchive" button.
- Archived teams page for choreographers: `/organizations/:id/archived` (ArchivedTeamsPage.tsx).

---

## Notification / Unread System

- Unread comment count per team is added to `GET /teams` for dancer callers by joining `comment_recipients` where `acknowledged_at IS NULL`.
- Unread comment count and `has_unwatched_video` per routine are added to `GET /teams/{id}`.
- `video_views` table records first-play events. `GET /routines/{id}` enriches each video with `is_watched`.
- Frontend badge: purple "X new" on team cards (Dashboard) and routine cards (TeamPage).
- Frontend badge: "New" pill on video cards (RoutinePage) when `!is_watched` and user is dancer.
- View is recorded in VideoWatchPage `onPlay` handler via `POST /videos/{id}/viewed`.

---

## Tailwind Brand Colors

Primary color: `brand-600` = `#7c3aed` (purple). Scale: `brand-50` through `brand-900`. Defined in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`. The review/watch pages use a dark theme (`bg-gray-900`, `bg-gray-800`) while all other pages use light theme (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-white`).

---

## What Is NOT Done (potential next steps)

- **Deployment** — not deployed anywhere yet; runs fully local
- **Video audio** — works correctly in the browser. The greyed-out volume button observed earlier was a VSCode preview artifact, not an app issue. Do NOT add `crossOrigin="anonymous"` to video elements (see Critical Bugs #6).
- **Video duration** — `duration_seconds` is saved as `null`; the frontend doesn't extract it from the video element before uploading
- **Version numbering** — currently counts existing videos for the routine and increments; this could race if two uploads happen simultaneously
- **Dancer subgroup visibility** — dancers see all subgroups on the team page, not just their own
- **Email notifications** — no notifications when feedback is added
- **Mobile responsiveness** — built desktop-first; review/watch pages have a fixed 320px sidebar that breaks on small screens
- **Video format support** — `.mov` files work but may not play in all browsers (codec dependent); no transcoding
- **Delete orgs** — no way to delete organizations
- **Pagination** — no limits on any list queries
